# CSH_Game_Jam_1

This was for a 24 hour game jam that me and a friend participated in.
It's a simple puzzle game, but even at that, it's not really a puzzle game.
Please feel free to take a look at the code, edit it, and see what you would have changed/added.


The "Puzzler" directory has the final game, and submission in it, the other two files where for testing, and the first idea for the game jam that was abandoned because of the overcomplicatedness.
All that I ask is that you give credit to the two game devs who worked on it

Ethan Nichols (Lead Programmer);
Rebecca Syria (Programmer / Artist)
